Installation and Deployment
===========================

Standard Installation
---------------------

**Set-Anubis** is a Python library requiring Python >= 3.8. It depends on the following *external* Python libraries:

.. include:: dependencies.rst

In addition, the Event Generation module requires:

- `Pythia 8.3 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3012>`_ (requires a C++ compiler)
- `MadGraph5_aMC@NLO <https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0301>`_ (optional, for advanced event generation)
- `HepMC3 <https://hepmc.web.cern.ch/hepmc>`_ (used by Pythia)

Installation Methods
--------------------

You can install all the necessary software using the provided `install.sh` script. This script automates the installation of Pythia, MadGraph, and HepMC3, ensuring all dependencies are correctly handled.

To install the software, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./install.sh <software1> <software2> ...

For example, to install `Pythia`, `MadGraph`, and `HepMC3`, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./install.sh Pythia MadGraph HepMC3

This command will install all the required components and their dependencies.

Available Software
------------------

The following software can be installed using the `install.sh` script:

- **Pythia 8.3**: Monte Carlo event generator for high-energy physics events.
- **MadGraph5_aMC@NLO**: A tool for simulating collisions at particle colliders.
- **HepMC3**: A data format used for storing event records generated by particle collision experiments and simulations.

Simply provide the names of the software as arguments to the `install.sh` script to install them.

Deployment Notes
----------------

Ensure that you have the necessary compilers installed:

- A **C++** compiler (e.g., `g++`) is required for compiling **Pythia 8.3**.
- **gfortran** may be required if using specific features of **MadGraph**.

Once the installation is complete, the software will be ready for event generation and other analyses.
