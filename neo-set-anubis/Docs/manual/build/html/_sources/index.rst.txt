Set-Anubis is a public tool for making sensitivity prediction on the Anubis Detector.

It can calculate Branching Ratio (BR) of any Beyond The Standard Model (BSM) model. It can also use Pythia or MadGraph
To generate events of pp collision. These events can then be analysed and classified (cuts) to make sensitivity prediction.
